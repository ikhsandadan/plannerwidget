# Weather Widget Planner App

I made a custom weather widget because I think it's suitable to be added to the planner app to see the weather condition in our area.

It's quite simple to use, we only need to allow the planner app to detect your current location but if it's not allowed then the weather widget won't show anything and a notification "Please Enable Your Location" will appear.

The weather widget provides information of your current location, weather icon, temperature number that has been rounded, weather condition, humidity level, wind speed, sunrise and sunset times.

I made it as simple as possible so it fits on other widgets and I use openweathermap API for the weather data.
